# infragit

Infragit is a plain text, git-centric CMDB for your IT environment.

This is an experimental work in progress.

Infragit frees your CMDB from proprietary tools by managing everything
as plain text files using the ubiquitous distributed version control
system, `git`.

Storing everything as plain text simplifies the process of creating 
custom scripts to search and report on your IT inventory.

By storing that plain text in git, we get auditable change logs,
access control, and the power of `git bisect` to report on changes
over time.  We also eliminate the need to maintain additional CMDB
related infrastructure.  Infragit is just a command-line tool.  There
is no server component.

The `infragit` command-line tool simplifies the maintenance of your
plain text CMDB content repos and manages ansible-based host and
configuration discovery.
