Top level directory includes...
 hosts
 networks

The hosts directory contains a list of unique hosts across the entire
infrastructure.

Under the networks directory, create a directory hierarchy that maps
to your network infrastructure.  Some directories will contain other
files and directories containing Host information is generated through
a discovery process.  Each one of these directories contains a file
called "_root".  This is an Ansible inventory file identifying hosts
from which to run discovery.  The hosts must be members of one of
several types of groups, corresponding to infrastructure types.  These
include the following:

 - libvirt for libvirtd hosts
 - nmap for discovery using nmap scanning
 - satellite for inspecting satellite inventories

Network interfaces need to be mapped to networks.

eg.  br0 > labdroid/home
